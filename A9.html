                July 2017) was an Iranian mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University.
                Her research topics included Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic
                geometry. On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in
                mathematics, becoming the first woman to win the prize, as well as the first Iranian. The award
                committee cited her work in "the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces".
                On 14 July 2017, Mirzakhani died of breast cancer at the age of 40.</p>
